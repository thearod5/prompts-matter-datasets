# Overview
Contains the official datasets used in "Prompts Matter: Insights and Strategies for Prompt Engineering in Automated Software Traceability".

We're working on releasing the parser we used to read these datasets from the `definition.json` file you see within each dataset, however, if you take a look at each file you can still deduce how to use them.

- `definition.json`: Custom configuration file used to define how to read the dataset.
- `traces.csv` will contain the links between artifacts

All other files will be artifact files. All artifacts are extracted from their sources linked in the paper.
