The code displays a privacy policy page that complies with HIPAA regulations for collecting and storing patient health information. The policy informs users that their personal health information will be collected and used for treatment, payment, and ongoing operations. While written consent is not required, users can opt out of sharing their information in writing. The policy states that the system aims to maintain security and access controls to prevent unauthorized disclosure of information."
/redirect,This code handles user authentication and authorization. It redirects the user to a secure page after authentication. The redirect ensures the user lands on the correct secure page for their user type. The code is likely part of a larger web application that has different pages for different user roles. The redirect code helps route the user to the correct page based on their authorization level. Maintaining such redirect logic helps enforce proper access controls within the application.
/template,"This code implements a web page template that handles common tasks like error handling, includes global and header/footer files, and sets a page title variable. The template allows developers to focus just on the central page content, reusing common elements on every page for consistency. Any exceptions are handled by the designated exceptionHandler page. Global variables and functions are defined in the global file, while header and footer markup is defined in their respective files."
/util/andystestutil,"This code snippet appears to be a utility page for testing purposes. A software engineer working on this system would use this page to:

1. Generate test data for the system using the TestDataGenerator class.  

2. Execute specific test data generation methods by passing their name in the ""execute"" parameter. 

3. See the results of executing those methods in the server console output.

4. Return to the main iTrust application after testing."
/util/blackbox/BlackBoxTestPlan,"Here is a summary of the key points:

• The code appears to contain test cases for an electronic health record or medical management system. 

• The tests cover a range of functionality for administrators, healthcare providers, and patients including: managing users, viewing lab results, scheduling appointments, editing patient records, and more.  

• The test cases specify preconditions, steps to execute, and expected results to validate the system's functionality.

• The code allows users like healthcare providers and patients to perform tasks like view records, prescribe medications, schedule appointments, and take satisfaction surveys.

• Events are logged for auditing purposes and the system has input validation to ensure data integrity.  

• The test cases cover use cases for different user roles to validate the system is functioning properly for all users.

• In summary, the code focuses on testing the core functionality of a medical management system for tasks like managing patient data, scheduling appointments, and viewing lab results and medical records. The test cases aim to validate that the system performs as intended for all users."
/util/blackbox/blackbox,"This code parses XML test plan data and displays it in an HTML table. The XML contains black box test cases with test ID, description, expected results, actual results, use case, role, date added and date modified. The code parses the XML, sorts the test cases by test ID, and displays them in an HTML table grouped by role. This allows a user to quickly view test cases relevant for their role."
/util/displayDatabase,"The code displays data from a database in an HTML table. It retrieves a list of table names from the database, then queries each table to get the column names and data. It generates an HTML table for each database table and adds a table of contents linking to each table. The code is meant for testing purposes only."
/util/displayWikiDatabase,"This code displays data from multiple database tables. It connects to a database and queries for all table names. For each table, it retrieves all columns and data within that table and displays it in an HTML table. This allows an engineer to quickly view data within the database for testing and debugging purposes."
/util/getUser,"This code is used to search for a user in a system by their user ID (MID) and display their name.

The code accepts an MID as input from a form, queries a database using that MID to retrieve the corresponding user name, and displays the user name along with buttons for the user to confirm if they found the correct user. 

Any exceptions during the database query are caught and an error message is displayed.

The code uses CSS styles to display the search form and results in a popup window with buttons for the user to confirm or search again."
/util/getUserFrame,The code is used to implement some user functionality within the iTrust system. It loads two JavaScript files to provide resizing functionality for an iframe and to retrieve user information. The iframe is used to display some user information in a hidden frame that can be resized when needed. The code keeps the implementation simple and focuses on achieving the required user functionality.
/util/resetPassword,"This code handles the password reset functionality for users of different roles. 
It first checks if the user has attempted too many password resets. If so, the user is redirected to an error page.
It then verifies the user's MID and role. If invalid, the user is prompted to enter these details.
Next, it checks if the user has a security question set. If so, the user is prompted for the answer to the security question along with a new password.
Finally, if the details are valid, the user's password is reset and a success message is displayed. Otherwise, error messages are shown."
/util/showFakeEmails,"This code is used to display a list of fake emails that were sent for testing purposes. The code imports various Java libraries and database connection classes, retrieves a list of Email objects from a database using a DAO class, and then displays the details of those emails in an HTML table. The code is likely part of a larger system for managing and sending emails."
/util/transactionLog,"This code retrieves transaction data from a database and displays it in an HTML table. It imports necessary classes, gets a list of all transactions from the database using a DAO factory, iterates through the transactions and displays relevant details like date, ID, type, user IDs and additional info in an HTML table. The purpose is likely to display transaction history for debugging or informational purposes."
